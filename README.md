# react-website-revised-design
I rewrote my website... again! 

I felt that my website didn't have a modern enough feel, so I took some inspiration and got to work! I decided to kill two birds with one stone by also making it a react.js website. Yes, react is definitely overkill for a portfolio site, but I felt it was necesarry. I wanted to practice my react and get better at it. 

I added a dark mode feature just for this purpose. I made a react class component and got to work. Right now the dark mode component is functional, but not what I want. I intend to make my next iteration with useState and useEffect hooks in order to maintain a more modern react codebase. And to maintain state via localstorage!
